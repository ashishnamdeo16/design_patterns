## 💡 Introduction

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like blueprints that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

This repository covers the three main categories:
1.  **Creational:** Mechanisms for object creation that increase flexibility and reuse.
2.  **Structural:** How to assemble objects and classes into larger structures.
3.  **Behavioral:** Effective communication and assignment of responsibilities between objects.
